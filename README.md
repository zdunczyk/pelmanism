pelmanism (pairs)
=================

With two or more players, take a regular deck of 54 playing cards (including jokers), shuffle them and then lay them out on a table face down. Then the game begins.

1. The first player selects 2 cards at random and turns them face up.
2. If they are of the same number (i.e. Seven of hearts and Seven of Diamonds), the player claims a "pair" and places them in front of him.
3. If they do not match but one of the cards is the first joker to be seen, the player may then declare the jokers to represent a matching number so that the two cards can be removed from play. All players must then remember that the other joker is now of the same number. For example, if the player turns over the 10 of diamonds and a joker, and then declares that the joker is also a 10, the other (hidden) joker must then also be treated as a 10.
4. If they do not match and neither card is a joker, you should turn them face down again.
5. The next player's turn then begins at step #2.
6. At some point all of the cards on the table should have been matched into pairs. The winning player is the one who matched the most pairs. Equal numbers of pairs will result in a tie.
